<div class="character"><img src="characters/the_brickster.png"><div class="description"><h2>The Brickster <span>voiced by David Lander</span></h2><p>The Brickster wants to steal the power brick to deconstruct the island. He was created by the Infomaniac so he could have a friend, but went crazy after the Infomaniac suggested creating more friends. Now he's sarcastic and a bit cruel, making jokes at your expense.
