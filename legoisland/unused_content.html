<h1>Unused Content</h1>
<p>By digging in the game files, audio has been extracted that helps reveal some of the unfinished, or scrapped ideas in LEGO Island</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an <a href="https://youtu.be/Mv-9-cHxU8k?list=PLh9o-GvfXb1gcG-oTTqriUQX8ZgqhGmEe">unused outro video</a> and accompanying music in the game's files. Most likely, this video would have played after exiting the game, before the credits.</li>
<li>There are two additional unused hat jingles for the Super Store. They contain the same lyrics as the jingle used in the final game, but have different melodies.</li>
<li>Saving LEGO Island was initally much more complex. It seems that saves would have needed to be manual, instead of automatic. The blue sign-in book was originally much more complex, containing reg/green brick choices to do things like delete users, and warn you if you were going to overwrite another user.</li>
