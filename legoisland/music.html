<h2>Music Fidelity</h2>
<p>Sadly, the music in the game was crushed down to a low sample rate (usually around 11025 Hz) so it would fit on the CD, so most of the songs we have today are of sub-par audio quality.</p>

<p>Most of the cartoony sound effects come from the <a href="https://www.sound-ideas.com/Product/409/hanna-barbera-sound-effects-library/" target="_blank">Hanna-Barbera Sound Effects Library</a>. In the opening video, a pitched-up truncated version of the infamous "<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/03/19/my-obsessive-search-for-the-voice-behind-an-ubiquitous-sound-effect.html" target="_blank">liberty 285, code 6, 105 North Avenue</a>" sound effect plays.
